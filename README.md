# Shuttle.Abacus

Provides a constraint-based calculation engine.

**Please note**: The initial development of this software took place in the latter half of 2009.  It is undergoing signficant refactoring to bring it in line with my current domain-driven design approach.  Please do not use this as a reference environment for domain-driven design.  It will eventually be useful for such a reference but not at present.
